# PytsEva

This Python toolbox contains an implementation of the Transformed-Stationary (TS) methodology for non-stationary EVA as described in Mentaschi et al. (2016). In synthesis this approach consists in (i) transforming a non-stationary time series into a stationary one to which the stationary EVA theory can be applied; and (ii) reverse-transforming the result into a non-stationary extreme value distribution.

This toolbox is free of external dependencies, and contains calls for both the statistical analysis and the graphical rendering of the results.

A version working with Python3 is available at the branch main of this project, and can be downloaded at https://github.com/lquadrani/PytsEva
